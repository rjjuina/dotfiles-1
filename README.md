## Update log
I did love and enjoy the key-bindings of vim, from the day I switch from the emacs, but I switch back shortly because of the 2 main reasons.
1. Emacs plugins works on my windows but the my vim got some problem and I have to dirty my configuration files so much to fixed.
2. I need to use playframework for development and the emacs support ensime very well.

I move from emacs to vim then to neovim and now I am using the spacemacs, I think the configuration for everyone will become the same after long period of learning and copying from others, so it is good to give the community driven software a try.
